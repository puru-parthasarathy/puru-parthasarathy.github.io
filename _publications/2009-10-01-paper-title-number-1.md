title: "Almost Exact Risk Budgeting With Return Forecasts For Portfolio Allocation"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: ' We revisit the portfolio allocation problem with designated risk-budget. We generalize the problem of
 arbitrary risk budgets with unequal correlations to one that includes return forecasts and transaction costs
 while keeping the no-shorting constraint. We offer a convex second order cone formulation that scales
 well with the number of assets and explore solutions to problem variants- on equity-bond asset allocation
 problems as well as formulating portfolios using index constituents from the NASDAQ100 index, illustrating
 the benefits of this approach.'
