excerpt: 'We recently improved our algo performance in rolls by fine-tuning our aggressive
 cross signal and improving our accuracy in tracking our queue position.
 Inthe June roll, our passive fills improved by almost 30% across all the CME IR
 spreads, and our arrival price slippage declined by more than 20%.
 Ourforthcoming changes include another signal, cointegration, which will further
 enhance our arrival price performance. We also plan to extend these improvements
 to rolls on other exchanges.'
