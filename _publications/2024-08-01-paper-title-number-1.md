excerpt: 'This whitepaper examines the optimal wait time for executing basis trades in U.S.
treasuries cash and futures markets. Due to network latency (∼8ms) between New York
(cash) and Chicago (futures), acting too quickly on an opportunity can reduce trade
success.
We analyze two key metrics:
Opportunity Rate – The proportion of target opportunities that remain available after
waiting a specified time period from when the opportunity first arose.
Hit Rate – The probability of executing at or better than the target price.
Using historical data, we find optimal wait times for different product pairs, finding
20–25 milliseconds as ideal.'
