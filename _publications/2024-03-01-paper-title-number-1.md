excerpt: 'We implement a new logic for the cash treasury smart order router (SOR) for
 aggressive crosses, which allocates quantities across venues based on a ranking
 algorithm that uses the venues‚Äô market impact and fill ratio.
 Simulation results using market data are shown for illustration, demonstrating a
 value-add of around 1/4ùë°‚Ñé of the BTEC minimum price increment ($39.0625)
 compared to the naive or random venue selection approach, specifically for
 aggressive crosses only'
