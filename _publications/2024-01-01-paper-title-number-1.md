excerpt: 'Block trades are privately negotiated transactions typically larger than their
 exchange-traded counterparts. Much has been written about block trades and their
 impact on microstructure. Academic papers such as Seppi[seppi1992block] 1 and 2 are a
 few to cite. Our current research focuses on block trades in Eurex futures interest rate
 (IR) product calendar spreads. Our focus on the rate calendar spread is motivated by the
 pattern observed in the enhanced trading activity of the blocks during the start of the
 calendar spread roll periods in the Eurex IR products.
 The analysis is based on the historical sample received from the Eurex A7 platform. The
 specific focus of this research is futures on Euro-Bund, Euro-Schatz, Euro-Bobl, Euro-OAT,
 Euro-Buxl, Euro-BONO, and Long and Short-Term Euro-BTP and we look at the period
 between November 2016 and March 2023. This article summarizes block trading on the
 spread contract on a few actively traded interest-rate futures on Eurex. The report also
 analyses the price impact of the block trades for the spread contract'
