excerpt: 'We revisit the problem of online portfolio allocation first introduced by Cover. We propose factor weigh
ing of the dirichlet sampling to construct universal portfolios that out-perform those using uniform dirichlet
 sampling. When the returns follow a factor model, we establish a lower bound on the average portfolio
 growth rate. We analytically establish that the wealth generated by the factor weighted dirichlet sampled
 portfolios dominate the wealth generated by the uniformly sampled Dirichlet portfolios. We corroborate our
 analytical results with empirical studies on equity markets that are known to be driven by factors.'
