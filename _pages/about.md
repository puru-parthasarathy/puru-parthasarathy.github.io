Welcome to my page! I was born in Tamil Nadu, India, and raised in Delhi. I pursued my engineering degrees at IIT Bombay, UCLA, and UC Berkeley, which led me to spend significant time in both the western United States (Los Angeles and Berkeley) and the eastern seaboard (Washington D.C. and New York). Currently, I reside in Bangalore, India.


Research Background
======
I hold a doctoral degree in IEOR (Industrial Engineering and Operations Research) and currently work as a senior quantitative researcher at Quantitative Brokers, a New York-based trade execution firm. My research and professional work primarily focus on the intersection of IEOR and finance. Over the past few years, I’ve tackled industry challenges, contributed to the U.S. Federal Government, and developed software for Wall Street banks, buy-side hedge funds, and high-frequency market makers.

I've created this space to share insights on my ongoing and future research collaborations. Beyond operations research and financial markets, I have a strong interest in computer science education. In my free time, I actively explore both the theory and practice of Indian classical music, particularly Carnatic music.
