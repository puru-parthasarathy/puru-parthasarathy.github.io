Welcome to my page! Originally from Thanjavur, Tamilnadu, my parents migrated to Delhi where I was raised. I've also spent a considerable amount of time in the Western United States (Los Angeles, Berkeley) and the Eastern seaboard (Washington D.C. and New York). I currently live in Bangalore, India. Although my doctoral degree is in operations research, I've been working on research and industry problems mainly in the area of finance for the past few years. Some are more shareable than the others, for various reasons. I've also written software for some of the larger banks and buy-side funds in the recent past. I've created this space where I want to share, going forward, further work that I and my collaborators plan to do.
In addition to operations research and the study of financial markets, I am also deeply interested in the theory and practice of Indian classical music [primarily Carnatic].
