Welcome to my page! Originally from Tamilnadu, India, my parents migrated to Delhi where I was raised. I got my engineering degrees at IIT Bombay, UCLA and UC Berkeley. Consequently, I've spent a considerable amount of time in the western United States (Los Angeles and Berkeley) and on the Eastern seaboard (Washington D.C. and New York). I currently live in Bangalore, India. 
  
Research Background
======
My doctoral degree is in operations research. I've been working on research and industry problems mainly in the area of finance for the past few years. Some are more shareable than the others, for varied reasons. I've also written software for wall-street banks, buy-side hedge funds and high frequency market makers in the recent past. I've created this space where I plan to share current and further work that my collaborators and I plan to do.
In addition to operations research and the study of financial markets, I am also interested in computer science pedagogy. I am also deeply interested in the theory and practice of Indian classical music (primarily carnatic).
